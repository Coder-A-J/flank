## Buddy System

Every task should have at least two people. Two people working on the task ensures the task gets to Done quickly. 
There's no single point of failure. Cross training is another valuable aspect of the buddy system. 
Code reviews will be faster as the buddy doesn't have to context switch to review the code. 
Having a buddy working on a task provides emotional support and  psychological safety as there's two people responsible for completing the work.

Work on one task at a time.

> Stop starting, start finishing. WIP limits encourage us to finish work thatâ€™s already in process before introducing more work into the system. 
>The more work teams try to juggle at once, the harder it is for them to take work to the finish line.

Buddies are empowered to determine how to best collaborate on each task. Ideas:
- One writes code, the other reviews.
- One writes the business logic, the other writes tests
- [Pair programming.](https://stackify.com/pair-programming-advantages/) One writes code, the other observes and guides. Roles can be switched anytime.
  - [Visual Studio Code Live Share](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/live-share/)
- One designs the APIs, the other implements
